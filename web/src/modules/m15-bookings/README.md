# M15 — Accommodation (and the shared booking engine)

This folder runs two modules from one codebase:

- **M15 Accommodation** — `/stays`, accommodation only
- **M16 Resources** — `/bookings` (alias `/resources`), tools and spaces — see `../m16-resources/README.md`

`BookingsClient` takes a `scope` (`stays` | `resources`); `SCOPE_META` in `lib/inventory.ts` sets each page's number, label, route, accent (`--bk-accent`) and categories. The loader is `BookingsPage.tsx` (`renderBookings`).

- **Admins and circle leads** add items to the inventory, tag them, and approve requests
- **Joining members and above** book items
- **Everyone** (even logged out) can browse what's in the inventory

## What users see here

- **Browse** — category chips (🏡 Accommodation, 🔧 Tools, 🏛 Spaces), tag chips from the items in view, search; cards show "Free now" / "In use until …" for members
- **Item pop-up** — details, booked times (with who), and the booking form. Accommodation books by night (check-in/check-out dates); tools and spaces by time. Overlaps are caught in the form and again by the database.
- **My bookings** — upcoming (with Cancel) and past/cancelled
- **Manage** (admins + circle leads) — pending requests with Approve/Decline, the inventory they can manage with Edit/Archive/Restore, "+ Add item"

## Routes

| Route | File |
|-------|------|
| `/stays` | `app/stays/page.tsx` → `renderBookings('stays')` |
| `/bookings` | `app/bookings/page.tsx` → `renderBookings('resources')`; `?category=accommodation` redirects to `/stays` |

Query params: `tab=browse|mine|manage`, `category=accommodation|tools|spaces`, `item=<id>` (opens the pop-up).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BookingsClient.tsx` | Page: tabs, filters, book / cancel / approve, item save and archive |
| `ItemModal.tsx` | Item details, schedule, booking form, manager actions |
| `ItemFormModal.tsx` | Add/edit item: category, tags, circle, capacity, approval toggle |
| `lib/inventory.ts` | Categories, status labels, permission helpers, formatting, error messages |
| `lib/queries.ts` | `ITEM_SELECT`, `BOOKING_SELECT`, row normalizers |

## Database tables

Migration: `supabase/migrations/20261101_m15_bookings.sql` (repo root).

| Table | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `booking_items` | Read: active items for everyone, archived for admins/circle leads. Insert: admin, or circle lead with no circle / a circle they lead. Update/delete: `private.can_manage_item()` — admin, or circle lead when the item has no circle, is in their circles, or they added it |
| `bookings` | Read: own bookings, or everything for joining+. Insert: joining+ for themselves. Update: booker (cancel only) or item manager |

- `bookings_no_overlap` — exclusion constraint (btree_gist): pending/confirmed bookings of one item can't overlap. Error code `23P01`.
- `bookings_guard` trigger — sets status on insert from `requires_approval` (pending vs confirmed; the client's value is ignored), blocks bookings of archived items, lets non-managers only cancel, stamps `decided_by` on approve/decline.

## Gotchas

- One row = one bookable thing. Five identical bikes are five items (tag them `bike`).
- Accommodation ranges are local midnight → midnight with `[)` bounds, so back-to-back stays don't clash.
- No notifications yet: leads see pending requests in the Manage tab and the badge count.
